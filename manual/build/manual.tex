\maketitle

\section{Overview}

You can always find the latest version of this build manual on \url{https://zlosynth.com/achordion/achordion-build-manual.pdf}.

This kit contains a printed circuit board (PCB) with all the SMD parts already pre-soldered. The through-hole components are left to be assembled by you.

Pay attention to the orientation and position of all the parts. Desoldering them would be difficult and may break the module. Also be careful not to touch the pre-soldered SMD parts with the soldering iron. Read through the whole manual first. Make sure you understand all the steps before you start soldering.

\section{Tools required}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Soldering iron
  \item Masking tape
  \item Small flat head screwdriver
  \item Side-cutters

\section{Bill of materials}

Start by unpacking all baggies into a bowl, so you don't lose any components.

\section{Daisy Patch Submodule}

The Daisy Patch Submodule is connected to the main PCB through a set of connectors.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Mount the four female 2\texttimes5 connectors on the pins of Daisy Patch Submodule. See figure \ref{daisy}. This will make it easier to properly align all the connectors.
  \item Plug the connectors of the submodule into the PCB through footprints marked as ``SM''. Make sure to put it on the correct side of the PCB, where all four connectors are marked.
  \item Solder all the pins in.
  \item Once done, carefully detach Daisy Patch Submodule to prevent it from getting damaged while progressing with the build. It may be a little difficult. Pull each connector by a milimeter at the time.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

\section{Power}

The next step is to solder on the power connector.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Take the male 2\texttimes5 connector and put it through the footprint marked as ``Power''. Make sure to put it on the correct side of the PCB.
  \item Solder all the pins in.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Front panel}

Now when all the internal parts are soldered, the next step would be to assemble parts sitting in the front panel.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Place all potentiometers in the PCB, do not solder them yet. The big legs on sides are used to snap the pot in.
  \item Put all jack sockets into the PCB.
  \item Put LEDs in place. The cathode (shorter leg) goes through the hole closer to the edge.
  \item Snap in the switch. Take care not to bend its leg. Don't push the switch all the way to the PCB. See figure \ref{front components}.
  \item Now when all parts are in, carefully put the front panel on them. Be patient aligning all parts so they fit through holes. The switch may be a little problematic, if you see it not getting through, use tweezers to align its bottom part. Don't worry about the LEDs for now.
  \item Put washers on the pots and jacks. See figure \ref{washers}. Pot washers tightly fit into the panel, don't be afraid to push them in.
  \item Tighten all the potentiometers and jack sockets in place with their nuts. Take care not to scratch the panel. Plastic tools are prefered, steel drivers should also serve well. If you only have pliers, put them in a thick plastic bag. Protect the panel!
  \item Solder in all the potentiometers and jacks. Only solder the three smaller terminals of each potentiometer.
  \item Use a masking tape on the portion of the panel with holes for LEDs, see figure \ref{masking}. Push the LEDs against the tape so they are even with the panel surface.
  \item Solder the LEDs. Then snap their legs off.
  \item Use tweezers to align the switch. The button should be holding right angle against the panel, with about 2 mm of it sticking out. Test that the button can be easily clicked and returns to its resting position.
  \item Once the button is in a satisfying position, solder one of its legs, double check it can be clicked and that it returns, then solder the remaining legs.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Knobs}

You can now put knobs on the potentiometers.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The silver part of the big knob is protected with a sticky foil. Peel it off.
  \item Put the big knob on the topmost potentiometer. Use a small flat screwdriver to tighten the screw of the pot. The screw should be pressing against the flat part of the shaft. Keep some distance between the knob and the panel.
  \item Put smaller black knobs on the remaining pots. Align them with the D-shaped shaft and press them in. You may need to pull them a little bit if you see they are scratching the nut.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Final assembly}

Connect the Daisy Patch Submodule to the main PCB to complete the build.
