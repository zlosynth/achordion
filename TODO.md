# TODO

- [ ] Make even quantization of input the default. Note in the docs that if white key quantization is not tracking accurately, alternative firmware is available.
- [ ] Switch to bootloader, to allow bigger firmware size. Adapt the build scripts, update the DEVEL and release note guides.
- [ ] Switch to the scale library of Arplus.
- [ ] Implement controlled mode, with scales being set by Arplus.
