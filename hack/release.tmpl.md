## Firmware

Achordion's firmware can be upgraded to obtain new features and bug-fixes. To do so, download the binary from attachments bellow, navigate to [Electro-Smith's web programmer](https://electro-smith.github.io/Programmer/) and follow the guide described under the "Display Help" button.

## Known issues

Due to white key quantization, the module is quite sensitive to inaccurate CV input of TONE. This is especially notable when the same CV is simultaneously used to control the pitch of another module as well. If you suffer from these issues, try the alternative firmware `achordion-firmware-x.y.z-even-quantization.bin`.
